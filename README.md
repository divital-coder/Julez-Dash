# Julez-Dash is a Julia implementation of Plotly's sample applications under the dash data visualization framework.

ðŸ”´ Plotly Dash, provides comprehensive documentation and a guide to get it up and running within the Python ecosystem. Dash offers a wide variety of sample apps built by the Plotly community, to showcase the power of applications built using Dash. A downside to those apps, is almost all of them are built in Python as a primary language of choice,  utilizing relevant dependencies (packages) within the Python ecosystem. 

Currently, DASH's documentation lacks a lot of information for implementing a bare-bones application in Julia.

Julia, being a seemingly promising language for mathematical modeling and data-intensive applications, needs some well-deserved respect from a framework built solely upon taking data in mind. This repository provides homage to a number of applications showcased under Plotly's Dash framework as sample apps but built entirely upon the Julia ecosystem using the Dash framework.
