# Julia-Dash-Utlities

ðŸ”´ Plotly Dash, provides a comprehensive documentations and a guide to get it up and running within the python ecosystem. Dash offers a wide variety of sample apps built by the       plotly community, to showcase the power of applications built using dash. A downside to those apps, is almost all of them are built in python as a primary language of choice,     utilising relevant dependencies within the python Ecosystem.  Currently, even the dash quick start guide for julia language lacks in the basic dash app up and running.

Julia, being a seemingly promising language for mathematical modelling and data-intensive applications,needs some well deserved respect from a framework built solely upon taking data in mind. This repository provides homage to a number of applications shohwcased under the plotly's dash framework as sample apps, but built entirely upon the julia ecosystem using dash framework.
